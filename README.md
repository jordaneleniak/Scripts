# Scripts

### newInstallation.sh - WORK IN PROGRESS
This is a script to reinstall software on a fresh installation. Currently for Fedora. As well as to edit my preferences and the GUI.

This file will need to be made into an executable.

Some of the required repos needed to install some software has been omitted for certain software. They were omitted due to being added in previous commands. I will be going back and adding them as comments once I am done writing the first draft of the script.

For now, if anyone wishes to use this script, it will have to be ran as is. Once all repos have been added and commented out, you then can delete any software you wish to not have.


Sorry for any inconvience. This file was orignially written for my personal use. I did not think of others wishing to use and omit certain software when I first started writing it. Nor did I think of future me wanting to switch software.
